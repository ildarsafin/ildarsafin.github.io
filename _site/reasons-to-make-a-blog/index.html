  <h1>Reasons for me to make a blog</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Today is 10 years after I’ve tried Ruby on Rails for the first time.</p>

<p>I have some experience of writing on Ruby on Rails. It’s been quite a long journey now.
I’ve been working in an outsourcing company for more than a year. Then I tried in startups two times.</p>

<p>I’ve made a lot of mistakes and learned a few things. I want to share my experience with you.</p>

<p>I’ve met with Ruby on Rails in 2012 after I’ve read stories about Airbnb, Twitter, I’ve read blog posts from 37Signals.</p>

<p>My first professional contact with Ruby was in 2013. 
I was working in a company that was developing web applications for a client. I was a junior developer. 
I was working there with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Then I had a tough but interesting experience in a startup. I was working as a full-stack developer there.</p>

<p>Then I had small break in development and I did a double-degree MSc in Ilmenau University. 
There I had a Master Thesis about deep learning and portfolio prediction.</p>

<p>Then I found a job in a Berlin startup. I was working there mostly as a backend developer but with multiple responsibilities.
I’ve tried a trailblazer framework for Ruby on Rails first time there.
Most of the fun there was to build an infrastructure in AWS with a whole pipeline of CI/CD and EC2 machines with auto-scaling. 
Auto-scaling based on load-distribution from CDN was a new thing for me. I’ve learned a lot about it. But it worked well! It was a great achievement for me and the company at that time.</p>

<p>Then I came to the current company and I am really happy to work here. 
I am working as a backend developer in a rapid-growing company. 
I don’t have such crazy things as DevOps in my responsibilities but I am still learning some cool stuff about development and I am really happy to work here.</p>

<p>It’s 2022 and it’s been quite a ride for these 10 years but I am still enjoying developing with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I think I want to switch more to Mobile Development, and refresh some things about Deep Learning from University but I am still eager to try new things in backend development and Ruby on Rails in particular.</p>
