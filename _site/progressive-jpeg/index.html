    <p>I started to use in my work the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/sections/167/">Progressive JPEG Method</a> project management technique, which is created by designer Artemiy Lebedev.</p>

<p>The point of this project management technique is that the project is always completed by 100% even if it has a detail level of 4 percent.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*gbEZUky1CwvOA-On.jpeg" alt="How JPEG is rendered" /></p>

<p>Depending on the available time the project can be worked through by the pixels level, or it can be on the concept stage. The first solution is ready by the time of speaking with the client.</p>

<p>The main point of this method is that every day you have a measurable and completed project which is detailed on a certain level. Every part of the project can be detailed as much as the client wants it. 
You decide on detail level of features at the last moment by a request from the client or by the time availability, which reduces the complexity.</p>
