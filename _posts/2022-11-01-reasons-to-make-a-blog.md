title: Reasons for me to make a blog

Today is 10 years after I've tried Ruby on Rails for the first time.

I have some experience of writing on Ruby on Rails. It's been quite a long journey now.
I've been working in an outsourcing company for more than a year. Then I tried in startups two times.

I've made a lot of mistakes and learned a few things. I want to share my experience with you.

I've met with Ruby on Rails in 2012 after I've read stories about Airbnb, Twitter, I've read blog posts from 37Signals.

My first professional contact with Ruby was in 2013. 
I was working in a company that was developing web applications for a client. I was a junior developer. 
I was working there with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

Then I had a tough but interesting experience in a startup. I was working as a full-stack developer there.

Then I had small break in development and I did a double-degree MSc in Ilmenau University. 
There I had a Master Thesis about deep learning and portfolio prediction.

Then I found a job in a Berlin startup. I was working there mostly as a backend developer but with multiple responsibilities.
I've tried a trailblazer framework for Ruby on Rails first time there.
Most of the fun there was to build an infrastructure in AWS with a whole pipeline of CI/CD and EC2 machines with auto-scaling. 
Auto-scaling based on load-distribution from CDN was a new thing for me. I've learned a lot about it. But it worked well! It was a great achievement for me and the company at that time.

Then I came to the current company and I am really happy to work here. 
I am working as a backend developer in a rapid-growing company. 
I don't have such crazy things as DevOps in my responsibilities but I am still learning some cool stuff about development and I am really happy to work here.

It's 2022 and it's been quite a ride for these 10 years but I am still enjoying developing with Ruby on Rails.

I think I want to switch more to Mobile Development, and refresh some things about Deep Learning from University but I am still eager to try new things in backend development and Ruby on Rails in particular.
