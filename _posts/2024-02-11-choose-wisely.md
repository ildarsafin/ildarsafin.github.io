Life offers two roads: one leading to big achievements, the other to simple joys. But watch out for the middle path—it's where dreams get lost and happiness fades.

Some chase big dreams, aiming for fame and success. They tackle challenges head-on, leaving their mark on the world.

Others find happiness in small things—a good laugh, a hug, or a quiet moment. They know joy comes from appreciating life's little moments.

But if you get stuck in the middle, you'll miss out. Life becomes dull, with no progress or joy.

So, choose wisely. Aim for big dreams or enjoy the simple things. But don't settle for mediocrity—it's better to try for greatness and fail than to never try at all.
